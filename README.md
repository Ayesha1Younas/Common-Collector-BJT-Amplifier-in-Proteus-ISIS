# Common-Collector-BJT-Amplifier-in-Proteus-ISIS
Project of Common Collector BJT Amplifier in Proteus ISIS
This project is based upon the transisitor in a type of amplifier in which the BJT is connected in such a way that its collector Terminal is common to Emitter and Base terminals.The signal are then amplified.
